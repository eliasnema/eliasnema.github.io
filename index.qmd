Hi, I’m Elias. By day I’m working at Stripe. Before that, I led search and recommendations at OLX, optimized VLDBs at EPAM, and built “real” things in a few mechanical eng startups.

I’m writing [a newsletter](data-feed.qmd) for engineers, focused on data applications, diving deep into systems, architectures, and foundational papers. In the [blog](blog.qmd) part, you can find more random observations about other things I like - charts, books, photography, movies, [football](posts/man_city_stats/city_stats.ipynb), and tennis.
