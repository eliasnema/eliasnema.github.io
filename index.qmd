Hi, I’m Elias. By day I’m working at Meta. Before that, I was scaling up local payment methods at Stripe, led search and recommendations at OLX, optimized performance for large databases at EPAM, and built “real-world” things in a few mechanical eng startups.

In the [Log](log.qmd) you can find some random bits and thoughts and in the [State](state.qmd) there more longer-form content.
