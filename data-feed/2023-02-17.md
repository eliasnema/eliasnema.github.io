## Deep Dive

Insightful analysis of implementing comparing data sampling implementation in DB versus on the client.[^3]

Article from Alexey Milovidov himself, that stretches over quite a long period of time and describes ClickHouse journey to the data obfuscation.[^4]

Short a sweet deep dive into Postgres Write Ahead Log (WAL) files and Log Sequence numbers (LSN).[^5]

## Business

[Real-money gaming company saves $1.5 million per regional expansion with CockroachDB.](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/real-money-gaming-cost-savings/)

A very interesting case from a [company](https://everactive.com) producing batteryless sensors, that continuously stream data used in all kind of manufactoring industries (chemical processing, district energy, rotating equipment â€“ motors, pumps, fans, compressors, etc.)[^6]
