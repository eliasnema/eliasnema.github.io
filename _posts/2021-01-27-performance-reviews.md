## Removing bias from 

Data, shmata. Everyone talks about it. The challenge is to use it for the greater good. 
The benefit is that we know where we are to make an informed decision about where to go. The challenge is to make this decision informed, not driven by data.
More so, when the data is related to people.

The process of performance reviews has a potential to be biased and one-sided. How can we leverage data to make it fairer? 

## Role Expectations
Any role starts with expectations. At OLX we use an engineering matrix of sort, which is inspired by the [engineering matrix from CircleCI](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/131XZCEb8LoXqy79WWrhCX4sBnGhCM1nAIz4feFZJsEo/edit#gid=0)

## Collecting feedback
The next step is to collect the feedback that's based on the role expectations. Currently we simply use google forms in a semi-automated way. Here is an example of how this might look:

![collecting-feedback]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pr/)

## Normalizing and Removing Bias
How many people, so many options. How do you separate signal from noise when everyone has their own biases and standards? We all come from different cultural and personal backgrounds. Not even speaking about job history and being used to particular work environments. Hence, we tend to evaluate others based on our assumptions and biases.
