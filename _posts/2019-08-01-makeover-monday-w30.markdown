## Introduction
I've always wanted to try the [makeover monday]{:target="_blank"} since I learned about the project. But _busy being busy_, you know.

Last week, however, two things happened:
- [Statistics](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w30){:target="_blank"} for the Arsenal's last season was posted as a weekly project (and I love football).
- I accidentally noticed that.

So it was decided - I'm creating a visualisation.


## Setup
I need to create it using something of course. What are my options? Data world provides quite some extensions there. After playing with a few (Tableau, Google DataStudio, Excel), I realised that the simplest and most flexible way to crunch some numbers for me was jupyter.

>For me jupyter beats other tools for the EDA.
> - I can `iterate quickly` due to the environment itself.
> - Slice and dice data the way I want with `pandas`.
> - Plot if instantly with `matplotlib/seaborn/plotly`.
> - Play with `sklearn` or anything else from the python ecosystem for more clever algos.

To be fair, I can get everything of the above in RStudio (and probably more precise stats and subjectively more beautiful visuals out of the box), but I'm more comfortable with the python ecosystem.


## Getting familiar with the dataset
Data represents some KPIs of players throughout the season. For example __Saves, Tackles, Passes, Minutes Played__, etc. Position data wasn't in the dataset.

Initially, I wanted to cluster players together to see if there are any patterns and groups. Then realised it doesn't make a good visualisation: hey look, these players have Saves, they are probably goalkeepers. So I decided to enhance the data with the information about positions.

> Hey look, these players have some __Saves__, they are probably goalkeepers.

With this data, let's look at performance by position. Maybe a [radar chart]{:target="_blank"} can work for such kind of comparison?

There is a limited amount of axes on a graph for users to still make sense of it. How to choose metrics to display? There are some obvious choices of course:__saves for goalkeepers, tackles for defenders, goals for forwards__. But how about common attributes such as __passes__ or __touches__?

To identify potentially interesting data points I started with a plot of correlations. I was looking for some interesting patterns, e.g. metrics that are not linearly correlated with the minutes played.

![correlations]({{ site.url }}/assets/mm/19w30/corr.png)

There are some:
- obviously **bad choices** (clearances off the line - only a couple of players have at least 1);
- not so obvious but **not really interesting** - the more you play the more your KPI is;
- and looks like there are some potentially **distinguishable** KPIs. 

What would be the best way to put it on the graph?

## To scale or not to scale?
If we want to create player profiles, we cannot just say Cech made X saves while Leno made Y. We need to normalise it. Most precise would be to do it by minutes played. So **tackles per minute played** or **passes per minute played**.

Having these numbers we can already iterate to find the best representation.

#### Ratios as-is
The good part here - real values are displayed for the KPIs. We can see Mustafi is completing around 0.06 clearances per minute played, more than anyone else.
The problem - it's hard to have all the numbers at the same scale, so some metrics skew the scale towards one direction and so it becomes hard to see values for smaller values.

> Mustafi - first in memes but also completing around 0.06 clearances and 0.025 tackles per minute, more than any other defender in a team.

#### Log-scaling
We can try to play with axis scales to get more equal distribution of numbers. As you can see now graphs are more equally distributed, but it's a mess in readability.

> You need to be careful using log scales, especially in a radar chart.

#### Relative scaling
We can divide values by the maximum for the metric at this position. So all players will get a percentage from the maximum for the position in a team. As for the example above: Mustafi will get 1 for the clearances, Sokratis around 0.8 from that and so on.

Personally, I like the last approach most, even though with it we are losing the interpretability. Now it's not possible to see the `real values` but the `relative comparison` is so much better. 

## Positions
Let's 
So let's just polish the graph a bit.

#### Goalkeepers
![GK]({{ site.url }}/assets/mm/19w30/GK.png)
>- Cech was getting around __20% of playing time__ compared to Leno.
>
>- Distinctive __styles__: Cech is doing much more high claims while Leno uses more punches.
>
>- Cech has a better __"saves per minute"__ ratio, but also might be the result of him playing much less.

#### 4 most played Defenders
![DF]({{ site.url }}/assets/mm/19w30/DF.png)
>- __Mustafi__ leads on most defensive metrics. He also played most minutes from all defenders (3rd overall, after Leno and Aubameyang).
>
>- __Sokratis__ has a similar profile, with the exception that he leads by far in yellow cards.
>
>- Bellerin and Kolasinac have more __offensive profiles__, both taking third place in overall team assists rank (5 each, Bellerin played less).

#### Midfielders with at least 20 appearances
![MFD]({{ site.url }}/assets/mm/19w30/MFD.png)
> There are two clear __patterns__ on the chart: __defensive and offensive__. Xhaka and Torreira are representatives of the former while Mkhitaryan and Ã–zil of the latter.

![MFA]({{ site.url }}/assets/mm/19w30/MFA.png)

> __Ramsey__ is an interesting exception of a "complete" midfielder here, leading by assists per minute played, but also participating in tackles a lot.

#### Top 3 Forwards
![FW]({{ site.url }}/assets/mm/19w30/FW.png)
> - Lacazette and Aubameyang are __2nd and 4th in most minutes played__ during the season.
> 
> - Lacazette __fouls five times more__ than Aubameyang or Iwobi.
> 
> - Aubameyang leads on __goals__ effectiveness, while Iwobi and Lacazette are great in __assists__.

## Final thoughts
I used canva to assemble the graphs above into the final [image]{:target="_blank"}, added some red-white colours. I didn't come up with any breakthroughs of course - things on graphs are already well known. However, I had a couple of interesting observations and discoveries during the process. And had some fun as well.

The greatest benefit was to document the process itself. As [Jason Fried]{:target="_blank"} [urges people]{:target="_blank"} to write more to really think the idea through, just sitting down and writing the process of analysis was really rewarding.
