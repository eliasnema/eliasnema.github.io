You should also check out a recent [deep dive into a foundational paper](https://www.eliasnema.com/data-feed/paper-transactional-model/paper-transactional.html) - ‚ÄúThe Transaction Concept: Virtues and Limitations‚Äù by Jim Gray, 1981.

## Focus: GEO

A couple of great posts from [Mark Litwintschik](https://tech.marksblogg.com/):

- Exploration of a FlixBus dataset and using SQL for some route planning.[^1]
- DuckDB for geospatial data (spoiler: it outperformed previous winner ClickHouse).[^2]

H3 extensions:

- [h3-duckdb](https://github.com/isaacbrodsky/h3-duckdb)
- [H3 indexes for performance with PostGIS data.](https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2022/06/h3-indexes-on-postgis-data)

Another approach is to use a web API-based geocoder. Here is an example from a Crunchy Bridge.[^3]

Using PostGIS in Supabase to build an app in Ionic Angular.[^4]


## Vectors

Following up on [last week‚Äôs issue about vectors](https://www.eliasnema.com/data-feed/2023-03-03.html), here is an amazing SQLite extension for vector search, that is based on faiss.[^5]
