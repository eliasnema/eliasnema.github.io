## Focus: Vectors

Using open-source vector similarity extension for Postgres[^1]:

- [What’s Postgres Got To Do With AI?](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/whats-postgres-got-to-do-with-ai)
- Using postgres\_scanner[^2] to [read vectors from PG in DuckDB](https://blog.eto.ai/vector-similarity-search-with-duckdb-44dec043532a).

A detailed paper from SIGMOD’20[^3] describes how Alibaba designed and built an approximate nearest neighbor search extension for vector similarity. Great deep dive into page structures for ANN indexes, and the [code is even available](https://github.com/alipay/PASE) (though, not maintained).

Using vector functions in SingleStore’s SQL, but not clear how well the system scales since the example uses only 7000 vectors.[^4]

An amazing use-case (as far as I’m concerned, [data swamps](https://www.datagalaxy.com/en/blog/data-swamp-vs-data-lake/) are real) of representing individual columns in the embedding space by utilising pre-trained transformer models. Then, using those vectors to find semantically similar data *within your data.*[^5]

## Deep Dive

A new lecture is out from the [CMU Advanced Databases](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2023/) course on [Parallel Hash Join Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqRV7Mss1Fg). If you are into data, you should have a very good reason for not watching this playlist.

## Business

Amazing (as always) write-up about using TimescaleDB in the wild, and why compression is crucial for the time-series databases.[^6]

An emerging buzzword for data platforms capable of both transactions and analytics workloads – “translytical.” A webinar from SingleStore describes precisely such platforms.[^7]
