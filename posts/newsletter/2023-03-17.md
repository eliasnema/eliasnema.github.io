## Focus: JSON {}

PostgreSQL can deal with JSON for a very long time (and here is a great history[^1] of it), but now is also able to write the server log in JSON format.[^2]

A deep dive into the potential performance issues when parsing JSON.[^3]

[The MySQL JSON data type.](https://planetscale.com/blog/the-mysql-json-data-type)

In SQLite, JSON functions are built-in and on by default since 3.38, along with `->` and `->>` operators, compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.[^4]

DuckDB:

- DuckDB can read JSON files as tables, and here is an example of querying GH Archive data.[^5]
- JSON support was a big part of a DuckDB 0.7.0 release.[^6]
