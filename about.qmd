Hi, I'm Elias. Here I'm writing about analytics, e-commerce, machine learning, books, football, and random things. By day I'm working at Stripe. Before that, I led recommendations and personalisation at the OLX Group, worked on databases and analytical systems at EPAM, and worked in a startup manufactoring dispense and spray machines.

Things I'm also working on:

- A book called "Hypothesize!"" about better ways of managing data products. You can pre-order it [here](https://gumroad.com/l/SSTiNM/kwfh1gn) at half price.
- An occasional newsletter ["Data Meets Product"](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/eliasnema) focused on news about data applications.
- [Here](talks.qmd) are some of my talks.
